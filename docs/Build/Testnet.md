Although it is a testnet token, it functions similarly to the actual Bitcoin (BTC) cryptocurrency.

It is important to note that the native token on the testnet does not hold any real-world value.

## RPC
The Bitlayer testnet provides the following RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints for interacting with the network:

 - https://testnet-rpc.bitlayer.org: This RPC endpoint allows developers to send requests and interact with the Bitlayer testnet programmatically. It is commonly used for deploying contracts, querying blockchain data, and executing transactions.
 - wss://testnet-ws.bitlayer.org: This WebSocket endpoint enables real-time communication with the Bitlayer testnet. Developers can subscribe to events and receive updates as they occur on the network.

## Explorer
To explore and inspect transactions, blocks, and addresses on the Bitlayer testnet, you can utilize the following explorer:

## Faucet
For testing purposes, the Bitlayer testnet offers a faucet that dispenses test BTC tokens. The faucet provides a way for developers to obtain test tokens without the need for actual value. 

You can access the Bitlayer testnet faucet at:
- https://www.bitlayer.org/faucet: By visiting this URL, developers can request a certain amount (0.05 BTC) of test BTC tokens to use in their development and testing processes.
